### What Is owvision?

**open weather vision** (in short _owvision_) is an open source software system, that allows you to build your own weather control center.

Currently it has four main features.

<Card title="Bare Metal Features">
    <ol>
        <li>⏲️ View your station's most recent sensor readings in realtime</li>
        <li>〽️ Navigate through your recorded historic weather data*</li>
        <li>🏆 Checkout historic highs and lows*</li>
        <li>
            ☁️ View a 7 day forecast for your weather station's set up location
            (via [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/))*
        </li>
    </ol>
    <i style="font-size:0.8em">*Still in development.</i>
</Card>

And all this for free, in an easy to use modern user interface. That's the idea behind owvision. Cool, isn't it😎?

### Getting Started

<Steps>

1.  **Check if your weather station is supported**

    _owvision_ just got released, that's why only a few weather stations are supported yet. If you are a developer, adding support isn't difficult.

    <LinkButton
        icon="external"
        target="_blank"
        href="/owvision/reference/supported-stations"
        variant="secondary"
    >
        Check support
    </LinkButton>

2.  **Download the daemon (_owvi_)**

    _owvision_ is a software system, that consists of multiple components. The core component is the **daemon**. In short it manages the weather database and therefore should be always running. Don't install this component on your personal computer, instead prefer a Rapberry Pi or a (virtual) Linux server.
    Added to that this host should be visible in your network (or better the whole internet).

    Currently only **debian based** systems are fully supported.

                Download daemon
            </LinkButton>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3.  **Start the daemon**

    After downloading the binary simply run following command to initialize the daemon. This will run the setup guide. If you have any issues here, don't hesitate to ask for help on our [discord server]().

    ```sh
    owvi init
    ```

    <i style="font-size: 0.8rem">
        \*owvi refers to the previously downloaded binary.
    </i>

4.  **Download the recorder (_owrec_)**

    The second very important component is the **recorder**. It is basically a simple buffer that is responsible for reading the station's current sensor readings using an interface and forwarding
    this information to the daemon.

    Install this component on the device that is directly connected to your weather station. This may be your server, but this is not mandatory.
    The recorder pushes data to the daemon, so the daemon has to be visible to the recorder.

    Currently only **debian based** systems are fully supported.

                Download recorder
            </LinkButton>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

5.  **Start the recorder**

    After downloading the binary simply run following command to initialize the recorder. This will run the setup guide. If you have any issues here, don't hesitate to ask for help on our [discord server]().

    ```sh
    owrec init
    ```

    <i style="font-size: 0.8rem">
        \*owrec refers to the previously downloaded binary.
    </i>

6.  **Find, download and start your interface**

    Interfaces are community written. That's why their installation procedure is dependent on the particular station. Find your interface [here](/owvision/reference/supported-stations).

    To check if the recorder detected your weather station run:

    ```sh
    owrec status
    ```

    After some time the daemon should also detect your weather station, check it (on your server) using:

    ```sh
    owvi station list
    ```

7.  **Download the official (mobile/desktop) app**

    :::note
    Downloads are not available yet.

    Finally you are ready to download the official dashboard.
